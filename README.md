Flutter Doctor Booking Application: Project Summary
This project is a comprehensive, multi-role doctor appointment booking system developed with Flutter (Dart) for the frontend and Firebase for the backend, offering real-time functionality across three distinct user types: Patients, Doctors, and Administrators.

Key Objectives & Functionality:
The application aims to simplify and secure online medical appointment scheduling, providing tailored features for each user:

Patients: Can securely register/login, browse available doctors (with their specialties, ratings, etc.), and book appointments. The interactive calendar prominently displays doctor leave periods, preventing booking on unavailable days. Patients can view and filter their booked appointments by status and cancel them.

Doctors: Manage their assigned appointments (confirm, reschedule with date selection, complete, cancel). They also have a dedicated section to apply for and track the approval status of their leave requests.

Administrators: Possess elevated privileges to manage the entire system. This includes adding new doctor accounts (creating Firebase Auth users and storing their detailed profiles), approving/rejecting doctor leave requests (with clear display of doctor name and reason), and viewing a comprehensive list of all appointments across the platform.

Technology Stack:
Frontend: Flutter (Dart) for a single-codebase native mobile experience on iOS and Android, focusing on a premium, user-friendly UI.

Backend: Firebase, leveraging:

Firebase Authentication: For robust user management and secure logins.

Cloud Firestore: A NoSQL database providing real-time data synchronization, efficient querying, and structured data storage (e.g., Timestamp for dates).

Firebase Security Rules: Essential for enforcing granular, role-based access control and data integrity.

Core Implementation Highlights:
The application uses asynchronous programming for Firebase interactions, robust error handling, and StreamBuilder for real-time data updates. It implements effective data models, UI/UX best practices (gradients, shadows, clear typography), and performance optimizations like client-side data caching and necessary Firebase composite indexing for complex queries.

This project delivers a functional, secure, and intuitive digital solution for modern healthcare appointment management.
